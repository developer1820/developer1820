##**Hello my name is Aarti Kacha.**##

I am pursuing my passion for software engineering at HyperionDev. I am learning in-depth Python development skills, such as data structures, object-oriented programming, troubleshooting, and working with various Python libraries. 
My goal is to start my career as a Python web developer and eventually become a full-stack developer. I have a strong foundation in web development, thanks to building a responsive website using Django and SQL as part of my CFG course. I am highly motivated, determined, creative, adaptable, and have problem-solving, attention to detail, critical thinking, communication, and time management skills. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies and to contribute to impactful projects that make a difference.
